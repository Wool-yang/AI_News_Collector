# Data Collection Module

This module is responsible for collecting AI news from various sources.
It will include scripts for:
- Fetching data from news APIs
- Subscribing to RSS feeds
- Web scraping for articles (where permissible)

## Technology Stack

- Python
- `requests` (for API calls)
- `BeautifulSoup` or `Scrapy` (for web scraping)
- `feedparser` (for RSS feeds)
- `APScheduler` (for scheduling tasks)

## Module Construction

- **Source Configuration:** Manage news sources (APIs, RSS feeds, websites) via a configuration file (e.g., `sources.json`) or a database table. This will store URLs, API keys, and scraping rules.
- **Fetcher Components:**
    - `api_fetcher.py`: Handles fetching data from configured news APIs.
    - `rss_subscriber.py`: Subscribes to and parses RSS feeds.
    - `web_scraper.py`: Implements logic for scraping articles from websites (respecting `robots.txt` and terms of service).
- **Data Standardization:**
    - Implement a standard article object/schema (e.g., title, content, URL, source, publication date, author).
    - Clean and normalize fetched data (e.g., HTML stripping, date parsing).
- **Duplicate Detection:** Implement a mechanism to avoid storing duplicate articles (e.g., based on URL or a hash of the title and content).
- **Storage Interface:** A utility in `utils.py` or a dedicated module to interact with the backend API or directly with the database for storing collected articles.
- **Orchestration & Scheduling:** Use `APScheduler` (or a similar library) to periodically run the data collection scripts.

## Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests (`pytest`):**
    - Test parsing logic for different data formats (JSON from APIs, XML from RSS, HTML from websites).
    - Test data normalization and cleaning functions.
    - Test individual fetcher components with mock data.
- **Integration Tests:**
    - Mock external services (APIs, websites, RSS feeds) to test the full data collection pipeline for each source type.
    - Test the storage interface with a test database or mock API.
